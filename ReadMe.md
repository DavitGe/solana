# Solana Labs

Welcome to the Solana Labs repository! This is a collection of hands-on experiments and projects as I learn and explore the Solana blockchain ecosystem.

## Overview

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications. This repository contains various labs to understand and experiment with Solana's capabilities, including smart contracts, tokens, and decentralized apps (dApps).

## Getting Started

To run and experiment with the labs in this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Git

<!-- ### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DavitGe/solana.git
   cd solana-labs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your Solana configuration:

   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```

4. Generate a new keypair or use an existing one:
   ```bash
   solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
   ``` -->

## Labs

Each folder within this repository contains a separate lab. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file with lab-specificinstructions
- The source code for the experiment

### Example Labs

- **Lab 1:** Generate Keypair

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have ideas to improve the labs or add new ones.
